# Maintenance API Contribution Guidelines

Thank you so much for considering to contribute to this project! :sparkling_heart: 

Hereunder you will find information on how and where to contribute and what kind of contributions we are accepting at this time. Please also familiarise yourself with our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) if you decide to make a contribution.


## Accepted Contributions :heavy_check_mark:

At this time, we are mainly looking for issue reporting such as bug reports or feature requests. This does not mean that all suggested code contribution will be discarded, but we will not provide detailed instructions on how to contribute to our code base at this time. 

That being said, smaller code contributions may be considered to be merged via pull requests, given reviewing capacity in the maintaining team. However developing environment and coding setup will have to be done by yourself.

### Reporting :writing_hand:
 You can submit an issue to this repository in order to report something. We have two templates; one for bug reporting and one for feature requests. Make sure to fill them out with the required fields and how it impacts both your solution and your users in order for us to have the best possible foundation for prioritisation.

#### Bugs :bug:

[Submit a bug report](https://github.com/equinor/maintenance-api/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=)

All bug reports are greatly appreciated. Make sure to include sufficient steps to reproduce and how this bug impacts your use-case and/or end users.

#### Feature Requests or Improvements :scroll:

[Submit feature request](https://github.com/equinor/maintenance-api/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=improvement-proposal.md&title=)

We will take any new feature request into consideration and initiate a dialogue with the requester. When the request is accepted it will be prioritised and planned for a sprint. Maintenance API is released monthly and expected delivery will be communicated after agreed upon.

New functionality will always go through a maturing processing where we reach out to you and draft necessary changes to our OpenApi specification to make sure we cover the new needs. After this is done, we will publish the updated specifications to our Test and QA environment, where you can start to use the API with the **new changes immediately**, with mock data. 

#### Security policy 

[Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/equinor/maintenance-api/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=security_report.md&title=)
